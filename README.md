## Getting started

### Setup Metamask with Goerli Testnetwork

1. Add Metamask to your browser.
2. Add Goerli Testnetwork to Metamask:
   - Network name: Goerli
   - New RPC URL: https://ethereum-goerli.publicnode.com
   - Chain ID: 5
   - Currency symbol: ETH
   - If the RPC URL doesn't work, search for a new one [here](https://chainlist.org/chain/5).
3. Mine at least 0.02 Goerli ETH from [Goerli Faucet](https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/).

### Setup Frontend

To set up the frontend:

1. Complete the Metamask setup mentioned above.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Obtain an Infura API key.
4. Add the key to the appropriate file.
5. Run the script using `node ./frontend/script.js` to test if everything is working properly.
